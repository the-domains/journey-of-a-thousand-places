This is Missy. My wife. In late November 2014, she was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer which metastasized to her brain. Doctors gave us 4 years. She died nine months later. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2b17528b-c619-4a3e-94f0-46a66003b620.jpg)

The only inkling that anything was wrong were headaches she kept having since August of 2014\. Some bad, some live-able, but nothing worrisome enough to warrant an MRI. Missy had epilepsy for most of her adult life and she's in the machine at least 1--2 times a year. One more visit to check on the headaches seemed, at the time, excessive.

I was awoken on the Saturday morning, after Thanksgiving with a loud "thud". I rushed to the kitchen and found my wife on the floor having a grand-mal seizure. She was writhing, shaking, her body tight, the refrigerator door wide open. I kneeled down to move her to a safer position. She had been in the middle of pouring herself orange juice and now the juice was all over the floor. I held her, saying out loud, "fuck me" as if this was the great inconvenience to our planned festivities for the weekend, none of which I even remember now. As I held her, I thought about the hours we would spend in the emergency room, the gamut of tests, the final report that would tell us, "she had a seizure, it happens, you're free to go". All of this in the 20--30 seconds while I held her. She was coming out of her grand-mal, which allowed me to dial 911, a semi-annual event in our small Brooklyn apartment.

But the weekend could still be salvaged, yes? Let's just get through this and we can go back to living our lives. The EMT arrived with their equipment, filling the apartment. Missy still on the sticky floor, recovering slowly, trying to comprehend what is happening, her brain re-booting. The EMT ran tests in the ambulance, blocking the narrow road to the nearest highway. Angry horns filled the quiet morning, not a care that there was someone in the ambulance in need of medical help. This is the cynical world of New York City in which we live. 

The hospital was busy, typical Saturday afternoon in Park Slope, the Saturday after Thanksgiving. A battery of more tests were prescribed. My wife slowly coming to her senses. Jokes and some laughter lightened the mood. We both hoped we could get out of there soon. We mentioned the headaches, maybe that had something to do with the seizure. Most likely it was nothing. Missy had headaches all the time. But an MRI, just so we can eliminate anything that might be there, a cause for the seizure.

I called her mother, her sister, my father...it was routine by now. "Okay, Andrew, call us when you hear more. Let us know how we can help" The results came back from the MRI. Spots or more precisely tumors in her brain. The doctor said they could mean nothing. There were such a thing as benign tumors after all. At least that was the hope. There was no chance that it could be anything bad. Certainly not cancer. No fucking way it was cancer. God couldn't be that cruel. Brain tumors sometimes come from someplace else, usually the chest. If they found nothing in the chest, then they could rule out lung cancer. A chest x-ray was ordered.

The call came in the next day...it was, in fact, cancer. The bad kind...Stage 4\. I held in my tears, choking on them as I listened to the doctor, my world collapsing all around me. "What the fuck is happening?" I couldn't, didn't want to say anything to Missy. I couldn't. Too fucking scared. How do you tell the one you love, the light of your life, the worst news in the world to hear? But I did. In slow, quiet, metered words, "you have cancer". The doctor came by, confirming the worst. I hated all of them. They were wrong. Take it back. Do it again. Anything but this. And yet there was Missy, her strength and courage my only beacon of hope, the light in the storm raging behind my eyes. "I want the best hospital and the best doctor for this", she quietly said. That I could do. I would rend the skies and tear the earth open to make sure she got. And we did: the best hospital and the best doctor. 

But none of it mattered. The disease did everything it could to kill her. It hammered her withering body with a ferociousness and ruthlessness that was swift and overwhelming. None of the radiation, the medicines, the countless visits to 67th and York Avenue, the side effects, the arguments, the nausea, the incontinence, the adult diapers, the MRIs, the CT Scans, the X-rays, the PT scans, the wheelchairs, nor the pain she endured did anything to help keep her alive. 

The four year average life expectancy changed to six months in one afternoon. The six months turned to a week at best, a few hours later. The week turned into a day or two at most, that same night. The day or two turned into the question one is brought face to face with when their loved one has been incubated and kept alive with machines...how long do we keep her on life support? I would have stared down into the abyss for all eternity than answer that question. Missy was my life. How long did I have to keep her alive? How long did I have to feel her warmth and breath? 

In the ICU, where machines surrounded her, monitoring her last signs of life, she took her last breath, surrounded by family and friends. Missy died on September 9, 2015 at 8:52 pm.

A day later, her oncologist called to offer his condolences. Her doctor, the expert, the world renowned thoracic specialist, with all the world's medicines and equipment at his disposal couldn't save her. He said, "we might have over-stated the hope". But it wouldn't have mattered. All we could cling to, all we could hear was hope. We only heard the best possible outcome. If we had been told, "she may have one year, but she may have six years" we would have only heard "six years". At least I didn't hear it. Maybe Missy did. Maybe she knew better than me. Like everything else, she always knew better than me.

The one time we did talk about life expectancy, I couldn't finish my sentences. This was a few weeks after diagnosis. I simply couldn't talk about it. But we had to. Fear so new, I didn't know how to process it, choked my throat. She asked me what I was afraid of. Everything, I told her. I told her I was afraid she might die...not that she would, but that she might. The idea of her dying from cancer was impossible. Her response, still something that stuns me. She said, "I'm worried about you". This woman, the focus of my happiness, when faced with her own mortality, had the temerity to be concerned about me, her husband. About what would happen to me. How would I go on living?

Yet here I am. Living. What right did I have? If I couldn't die with her, the only thing I wanted was to escape. To run away from everyone I know. Away from the familiar. Away from the past. Away from anything and everything that reminds me of the awfulness of everything. None of it was fair. Missy, the real-life angel was gone. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0b061158-4d36-48c4-b463-e5f1a00b9d84.jpg)

The "why" of it could never be answered. So I left. Not sure why. I don't know what I'd be looking for or what I hope to find with a little solitude. Some closure? Some understanding? Some sense? I don't imagine I will ever find the answers. Maybe I just needed a place to scream my fucking head off.
