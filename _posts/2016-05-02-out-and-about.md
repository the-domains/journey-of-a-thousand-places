Just like it was last year and the year before that and the year before that. Year after year, the same reasons, the same excuses. You never expect your circumstances to get worse. No. You're an optimist. That's what that means. Things will always get better. Until they don't. "

To travel the world and see some cool stuff is in everyone's List of Things to Do Before You Die. Just like skydiving, learn another language or read "Ulysses" by James Joyce. You know...things that you will never do. But, you know...maybe one day. When you run out of things to do. When you find the time. When you have some extra money. Never a priority. Always a longing desire. 

You wait for your circumstances to get better, meaning richer. When you can afford to travel. When you have the time. Things are a little crazy right now. Just like it was last year and the year before that and the year before that. Year after year, the same reasons, the same excuses. You never expect your circumstances to get worse. No. You're an optimist. That's what that means. Things will always get better. Until they don't. 

They get terribly worse. And then it gets really bad. And then the thing you fear the most in the world. Your worst nightmare happens. And there is nothing you can do but cry and watch. They say losing a spouse is second only to losing a child in terms of pain. You thank God you don't have kids. 

But then you get through it. You survive. And you find yourself on the other side of tragedy. A broken and wounded person, but alive. Pain is still there, yet every day it diminishes. You don't want it to because to do so would feel like a betrayal. Survivor's guilt. A depression. Call it what you want. But there you are, the thing you were most afraid of happening, happened. Now what?

The irony that it took my wife's death to find my own life is not lost on me. I can look at it as her parting gift to me, but you're supposed to be happy when you get a gift, right? But still...now what? With no responsibilities to anyone but myself, I decided to do the thing that I thought would make me happy...travel.

Yes, of course, around the world sounds like a great plan. But where? What's the first stop? Where do I go from there? When will I know when I'm done? Is two years enough? Is it too much? I knew I wanted to see beautiful places, roast myself on tropical beaches, swim with sharks, climb volcanoes, meet amazing people, eat fantastic food. You know, the "Eat, Pray and Love" tour. Bali sounded nice. I've always loved Thailand. Then what? India? Iceland? Galapagos? Does that constitute a world tour?

Luckily, someone (or some people) made a [list][0]. A very good one. One filled with learning, adventure and the beauty that this world had to offer. So, that's the route. That's the map. That's what I've set out to do. For in the wake of tragedy, it's hard to believe in much beyond yourself anymore. Certainly not in God nor in the wonder of life nor in the beauty of the world. So, I am choosing to find it. Find the beauty in the world. Because maybe, maybe, maybe, when I think about the unfairness of Missy's death, I can find something wonderful to celebrate. Something mysterious. Something magical. Something sacred. Something beautiful.
